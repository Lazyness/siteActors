                    </div>
                    <p class="p__inner">Olya was born in Leningrad, in the military family of Igor Dmitrievich and Irina
                        Alexandrovna Buzov. The girl learned to walk and speak very early, by the age of three, having
                        already learned to read and write, she began to study English.<br></p>
                    <p class="p__inner">When Olya was five years old, her mother, who believed that her daughter was
                        growing up as a child prodigy, sent her to school. At first, it was difficult for little Buzova
                        among her seven-year-old classmates, and some subjects were difficult, but thanks to her
                        perseverance and sociable nature, the girl quickly became an excellent student and the soul of
                        the company.<br></p>
                    <p class="p__inner">Buzova's parents were real intellectuals: most of the family budget was spent on
                        education and travel, and once Olya, who dreamed of new clothes and jewelry, was presented with
                        a piano for her birthday.<br></p>
                    <p class="p__inner">Olga Buzova earned her first money at the age of 13 - she worked as a counselor
                        in the camp. Already at the age of 15, the girl got a job in a modeling agency. Buzova later
                        shared that she spent the first 2,000 rubles she earned as a model on red velvet jeans and
                        proudly walked around school in them. Since childhood, the girl dreamed of an acting career, but
                        her parents strictly said - “No”. In 2002, Olga Buzova graduated from school No. 631 with a
                        silver medal and entered the Faculty of Geography of St. Petersburg State University.<br><br>

                        show "Dom-2" from the very beginning - she came to the project about a week and a half after the
                        start, on May 22, 2004. To participate in the project, the girl took an academic leave at the
                        university (at the age of 24, the girl nevertheless received a red diploma from St. Petersburg
                        State University). The charming blonde, who had barely reached the age of majority, easily
                        joined the team, received the cute nickname "Buzyonysh" and soon formed a couple with Roman
                        Tretyakov. Their relationship lasted three years, the Buzova-Tretyakov tandem was recognized as
                        the most romantic couple of the first season of Doma-2, along with Alena Vodonaeva and Stepan
                        Menshikov, Olga Nikolaeva and May Abrikosov.<br></p>
                    <p class="p__inner">During the eighth season of the show, which started in December 2006, Roman
                        Tretyakov left the project, saying that he was "tired of the aquarium life." He settled in
                        Moscow, thought about what to do after the project, and waited for Olga, but she was in no hurry
                        to leave the sidelines of the House. As a result, Buzova chose to continue her career as a
                        reality show star, and the relationship came to an end.<br></p>
                    <p class="p__inner">In December 2008, Olga Buzova announced her intention to leave Dom-2. The
                        producers did not want to lose the last of the "golden composition" of "House-2" and invited the
                        girl to become a co-host of Ksenia Borodina and Ksenia Sobchak and provided her with the post of
                        chief editor of the World of Reality Show magazine. House 2"<br></p>

                    Buzova's favorite fragrance. True, the publication looked more like a colorful album than a book -
                    on each spread, readers were waiting for bright photographs of their idol.<br></p>

                    Although many music experts were critical of the vocal abilities of the TV personality, the
                    composition “Get Used” released two months later repeated the success of the first song.<br></p>

            <p class="p__inner">Recently, Olga Buzova decided to master a new hobby for herself - pole dancing. After a
                series of classes, the artist decided to show what she had already learned. The blonde posted a video in
                which she demonstrated juicy movements, which caused a storm of discussions on the Web.<br></p>
            <p class="p__inner">35-year-old Olga Buzova boasted of learned movements. In the frame, the artist appeared
                in a spicy bodysuit that exposed her elastic buttocks and emphasized the slenderness of her legs. No
                less hot were the movements of the performer of the hit "Few Halves". The singer twisted her hips,
                curved sexually and circled around the pole. Hello, new week. Grandiose plans,” she playfully signed the
                publication.<br></p>
            <p class="p__inner">The video has received mixed reactions in the comments. Some admired Buzova's figure,
                while others attacked her with sarcasm, accusing her of lack of flexibility and promiscuity. "Don't be
                ridiculous, a log will always remain a log"; “Then you wonder why they laugh at you ?!”; “Well, this is
                actually overkill. Prostitute?" users are angry.<br><br></p>

                the feeling of your body ... In general, this is the third lesson, and I just want more ... ”the star
